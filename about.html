    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My travel type is “hope for the best but prepare for the worst”. From my experience, traveling is so unpredictable. U could face smth u didn’t expect at all. Anyway, I like taking risks. This gives me a huge portion of life energy and inspiration. Sometimes the experience and impressions of traveling was shocking for me, sometimes pleasant, it’s ok, u know. But every trip I have a plan B in case smth would go very bad. And it doesn’t make me feel frustrated, it just makes me feel prepared ;</p>
